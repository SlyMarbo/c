# c

A simple C 'interpreter' hacked together in half an hour.

* Just start it up and enter a line of C code.
* You can use semicolons to enter multiple commands in a single line.
* Hitting enter will wrap your code in a main function, write to a temporary file,
compile to an executable in a temporary file, execute it, and clear up afterwards.
* Compiler warnings are ignored but all other output is printed.
* You can then enter more code or enter a blank line (or 'q') to quit.

Enjoy.
